The game focuses on strategic team play, precise gunplay, and the effective use of character abilities to gain an advantage over the opposing team.
Characters (Agents):

Each Agent in Valorant has a set of unique abilities divided into signature abilities, a standard ability that can be purchased, and an ultimate ability that charges over time or by completing objectives.
Agents come from various countries and have diverse backgrounds, offering players a range of playstyles and strategies.</p>
